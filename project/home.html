I know some of these menus can be overwhelming, so I got you covered with my favorite dishes too. Not every one of these restaurants has a Michelin Star, in fact some of them are quite literally holes in the wall. Here is your guide for eating out in Manhattan so sit back, and enjoy.

<p class="feature"> Eating out, especially in this city, can sometimes get expensive. The brokerage firm reports New Yorkers spend $8,082 per year on restaurant dining... The national average is $3,512. I don't suggest eating out every day, but when it's a special occasion or you're getting tired of cooking at home, be sure to pick one of the restaurants that catches your eye on this page.  </p>
