    I am currently interning for a digital health startup that supports people with type 2 diabetes. For the past three semesters, I was a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> for a psychology lab studying memory at Syracuse where I administered the study and analyzed the data. Also, I am an Amazon Prime Student Campus Manager at Syracuse, in which I utilize social media platforms to create and publish creative content to promote Prime Student.
